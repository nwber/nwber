### Nick Bergeron

SRE trying his best. I have a good amount of infra experience, but want to get better at this dev stuff.

I'm currently learning Python and a bit of Go. Some good(?) examples of my work are here:

- [jorts](https://github.com/nwber/jorts), a url shortener running on CloudFlare workers.
- [garfacts](https://github.com/nwber/garfacts), a FastAPI app that returns facts about Garfield the cat. Pipelines are a WIP.
- [heartbeat-go](https://github.com/nwber/heartbeat-go), health check CLI tool (a bit old)
